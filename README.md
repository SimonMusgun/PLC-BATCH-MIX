# PLC Project Batch Mixing System

## Overview

The PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) project aims to design and implement a batch mixing system for industrial processes. This system will automate the process of mixing various ingredients in predetermined quantities to produce a final product. 

## Objectives

1. **Automated Mixing:** Develop a system to automate the mixing process based on predefined recipes.
2. **Ingredient Monitoring:** Monitor ingredient levels and ensure precise measurements for each batch.


## Components

1. **PLC:** Select a suitable PLC model capable of handling the requirements of the mixing system.
2. **Sensors:** Utilize sensors such as flow meters, level sensors, and temperature sensors to monitor ingredients.
3. **Actuators:** Control valves, pumps, and motors to regulate the flow of ingredients.
